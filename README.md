# Spaceship Passenger Transport Prediction

This project is focused on predicting whether a passenger will be transported on a spaceship using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is from a Kaggle competition, and various data preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling techniques are applied to achieve the best prediction accuracy.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to predict the outcome (transportation) of passengers based on their personal and voyage-related features. The dataset includes various attributes such as passenger ID, age, cabin information, spending patterns, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset is available from a Kaggle competition and includes both training and test data files:
- `train.csv`: The training dataset used to build the model.
- `test.csv`: The test dataset used to evaluate the model's performance.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.10 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
